# Open Your Own Treasure House

Daiju visited the master Baso in China. 

Baso asked: "What do you seek?" 

"Enlightenment," replied Daiju.

"You have your own treasure house. Why do you search outside?" Baso asked. 

Daiju inquired: "Where is my treasure house?"

Baso answered: "What you are asking is your treasure house."

Daiju was enlightened! Ever after he urged his friends: "Open your own treasure house and use those treasures."
