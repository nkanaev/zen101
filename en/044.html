    <h1>The Thief Who Became a Disciple</h1>
    <p>One evening as Shichiri Kojun was reciting sutras a thief with a sharp sword entered, demanding either his money or his life, Shichiri told him: 'Do not disturb me. You an find the money in that drawer.' Then he resumed his recitation.</p>
    <p>A little while afterwards he stopped and called: 'Don't take it all. I need some to pay taxes with tomorrow.’</p>
    <p>The intruder gathered up most of the money and started to leave. 'Thank a person when you receive a gift,' Shichiri added. The man thanked him and made off.</p>
    <p>A few days afterwards the fellow was caught and confessed, among others, the offence against Shichiri. When Shichiri was called as a witness he said: ‘This man is no thief, at least as far as I am concerned. I gave him the money and he thanked me for it.'</p>
    <p>After he had finished his prison term, the men went to Shichiri and became his disciple.</p>
