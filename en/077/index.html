    <h1>NO Attachment to Dust</h1>
<p>Zengetsu, a Chinese master of the T’ang dynasty, wrote the following advice for his pupils:</p>
<p>Living in the world yet not forming attachments to the dust of the world is the way of a true Zen student.</p>
<p>When witnessing the good action of another encourage yourself to follow his example. Hearing of the mistaken action of another, advise yourself not to emulate it.</p>
<p>Even though alone in a dark room, be as if you were facing a noble guest. Express your feelings, but become no more expressive than your true nature.</p>
<p>Poverty is your treasure. Never exchange it for an easy life.</p>
<p>A person may appear a fool and yet not be one. He may only be guarding his wisdom carefully.</p>
<p>Virtues are the fruit of self-discipline and do not drop from heaven of themselves as does rain or snow.</p>
<p>Modesty is the foundation of all virtues. Let your neighbors discover you before you make yourself known to them.</p>
<p>A noble heart never forces itself forward. Its words are a rare gems seldom displayed and of great value.</p>
<p>To a sincere student, every day is a fortunate day. Time passes but he never lags behind. Neither glory nor shame can move him.</p>
<p>Censure yourself, never another. Do not discuss right and wrong.</p>
<p>Some things though right, were considered wrong for generations. Since the value of righteousness may be recognized after centuries, there is no need to crave an immediate appreciation.</p>
<p>Live with cause and leave results to the great law of the universe. Pass each day in peaceful contemplation.</p>
