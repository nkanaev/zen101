    <h1>The Tea-Master and the Assassin</h1>

<p>Taiko, a warrior who lived in Japan before the Tokugawa era, studied</p>

<p>Cha-no-yu, tea etiquette, with Sen no Rikyu, a teacher of that aesthetical expression of calmness and contentment.</p>

<p>Taiko&#8217;s attendant warrior Kato interpreted his superior&#8217;s enthusiasm for tea etiquette as negligence of state affairs, m he decided to kill Sen no Rikyu. He pretended to make a social call upon the tea-master and was invited to drink tea.</p>

<p>The master, who was well skilled in his art, saw at a glance the warrior&#8217;s intention, so he invited Kato to leave his sword outside before entering the room for the ceremony, explaining that Cha-no-yu represents peacefulness itself.</p>

<p>Kato would wt Isten to this &#8220;I am a warrior,&#8221; he said. I always have my sword with me. Cha-no-yu or no Cha-no-yu. I have my sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Bring your sword in and have some tea,&#8221; consented Sen no Rikyu.</p>

<p>The kettle was boiling on the charcoal fire. Suddenly Sen no Rikyu tipped it over. Hissing steam arose filling the room with smoke and ashes. The startled warrior ran outside.</p>

<p>The tea-master apologized. &#8220;It is my mistake. Come back in and have some tea. I have your sword here covered with ashes and will clean it and give it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this predicament the warrior realized he could not very well kill the tea-master, so he gave up the idea.</p>
