    <h1>A Mother's Advice</h1>
<p>Jiun, a Shingon master, war a well-known Sanskrit scholar of the Tokugawa era. When he was young he used to deliver lectures to his brother students.</p>
<p>His mother heard about this and wrote him a letter:</p>
<p>'Son, I do not think you become a devotee of the Buddha because you desire to turn into a walking dictionary for others. There is no end to information and commentation, glory and honor. I wish you would stop this lecture business. Shut yourself up in a little temple in a remote part of the mountain. Devote your time to meditation and in this way attain hue realization.'</p>
