    <h1>The True Path</h1>

<p>Just before Ninakawa passed away the Zen master Ikkyu visited him. &#8220;Shall I lead you on Ikkyu asked. Ninakawa replied: &#8220;I came here alone and I go alone. What help could you be to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ikkyu answered: &#8220;If you think you really come and go, that is your delusion. Let me show you the path on which there is no coming and no going.&#8221;</p>

<p>With his words Ikkyu had revealed the path so clearly that Ninakawa smiled and passed away.</p>
