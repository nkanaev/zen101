    <h1>Eating the Blame</h1>
    <p>Circumstances arose one day which delayed preparation of the dinner of a Sate Zen master, Fugai, and his followers. In haste the cook went to the garden with his curved knife and cut off the tops of green vegetables, chopped them together, and made soup, unaware that in his haste he had included a part of a snake in the vegetables.</p>
    <p>The followers of Fugai thought they never had tasted such good soup. But when the master himself found the snake's head in his bowl, he summoned the cook, 'What is this?' he demanded, holding up the head of the snake.</p>
    <p>'Oh, thank you, master,' replied the cook, taking the morsel and eating it quickly.’</p>
