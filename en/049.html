    <h1>Black-Nosed Buddha</h1>
    <p>A nun who was searching for enlightenment made a statue of Buddha and covered it with gold leaf. Wherever she went she carried this golden Buddha with her.</p>
    <p>Years passed and, still carrying her Buddha, the nun came to live in a small temple in a country where there were many Buddha’s, each one with its own particular shrine.</p>
    <p>The nun wished to burn incense before her golden Buddha. Not liking the idea of the perfume straying to the others, she devised a funnel through which the smoke would ascend only to her statue. This blackened the nose of the Golden Buddha making it especially ugly.</p>
