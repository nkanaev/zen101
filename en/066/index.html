    <h1>Children of His Majesty</h1>
<p>Yamaoka Tesshu was a tutor of the emperor. He was also a master of fencing and a profound student of Zen. His home was the abode of vagabonds. He had but one suit of clothes, for they kept him always poor.</p>
<p>The emperor, observing how worn his garments were, gave Yamaoka some money to buy new ones. The next rime Yamaoka appeared he wore the same old outfit.</p>
<p>'What became of the new clothes, Yamaoka?' asked the emperor.</p>
<p>'I provided clothes for the children of Your Majesty,' explained Yamaoka.</p>
