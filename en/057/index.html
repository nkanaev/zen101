    <h1>The Gates of Paradise</h1>

<p>A soldier named Nobushige came to Hakuin, and asked: &#8220;Is there really a paradise and a hell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? " Inquired Hakuin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a samurai,&#8221; the warrior replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, a soldier!&#8221; exclaimed Hakuin. &#8220;What kind of ruler would have you as his guard? Your face looks like that of a beggar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobushige became so angry that he began to draw his sword, but Hakuin continued: &#8220;So you have a sword! Your weapon is probably much too dull to cut off my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Nohushige drew his sword Hakuin remarked: &#8220;Here open the gates of hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words the samurai, perceiving the master&#8217;s discipline, sheathed his sword and bowed. &#8220;Here open the gates of paradise,&#8221; said Hakuin.</p>
