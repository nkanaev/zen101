    <h1>The Sound of One Hand</h1>

<p>The masts of Kennin temple was Mokurai, Silent Thunder. He had a little protégé named Toyo who was only twelve</p>

<p>years old. Toyo saw the olds disciples visit the master&#8217;s room each morning and evening to receive instruction in sanzen or personal guidance in which they were given koans to stop mind- wandering.</p>

<p>Toro wished to do sanzen also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a while,&#8221; said Mokurai. &#8220;You are too young.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the child insisted, so the teacher finally consented.</p>

<p>In the evening little Toyo went at the props time to the threshold of Mokurai&#8217;s sanzen room. He struck the gong to announce his presence, bowed respectfully three times outside the door, and went to sit before the master in respectful silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can hear the sound of two hands when they clap together,&#8221; said Mokurai. &#8220;Now show me the sound of one hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toyo bowed and went to his room to consider this problem. From his window he could hear the music of the geishas. &#8220;Ah, I have it!&#8221; he proclaimed.</p>

<p>The next evening, when his teacher asked him to illustrate the sound of one hand, Toyo began to play the music of the geishas.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Mokurai. That will never do. That is not the sound of one hand. You"ve not got it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thinking that such music might interrupt, Toyo moved his abode to a quiet place. He meditated again. &#8220;What can the sound of one hand be?&#8221; He happened to hear some water dripping. &#8220;I have it,&#8221; imagined Toyo.</p>

<p>When he next appeared before his teacher, Toyo imitated dripping water.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Mokurai. That is the sound of dripping water, but not the sound of one hand. Try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain Toyo meditated to hear the sound of one hand. He heard the sighing of the wind. But the sound was rejected.</p>

<p>He heard the cry of an owl. This also was refused. The sound of one hand was not the locusts.</p>

<p>For more than ten times Toyo visited Mokurai with different sounds. All were wrong. For almost a year he pondered what the sound of one hand might be.</p>

<p>At last little Toyo entered true meditation and transcended all sounds. &#8220;I could collect no more,&#8221; he explained later.&#8221; so I reached the soundless sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toyo had realized the sound of one hand.</p>
