    <h1>A Letter to a Dying Man</h1>

<p>Bassui wrote the following letter to one of his disciples who was about to die:</p>

<p>The essence of your mind is not born so it will never die. It is not an existence, which is perishable. It is not an emptiness, which is a mere void. It has neither color nor form. It enjoys no pleasures and suffers no pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you are very ill. Like a good Zen student, you are facing that sickness squarely. You may not know exactly who is suffering, but question yourself: What is the essence of this mind? Think only of this. You will need no more. Covet nothing. Your end which is endless is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air.&#8221;</p>
