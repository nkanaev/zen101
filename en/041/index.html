    <h1>Joshu&#8217;s Zen</h1>

<p>Joshu began the study of Zen when he was sixty years old and continued until he was eighty, when he realized Zen.</p>

<p>He taught from the age of eighty until he was one hundred and twenty. A student once asked him: &#8220;If I haven"t anything in my mind, what shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joshu replied: &#8220;Throw it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I haven"t anything how on I throw it out?&#8221; continued the questioner. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Joshu, &#8220;then carry it out.&#8221;</p>
