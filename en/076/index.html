    <h1>The Stone Mind</h1>
<p>Hogen, a Chinese Zen teacher, lived alone in a small temple in the country. One day four traveling monks appeared and asked if they might make a fire in his yard to warm themselves.</p>
<p>While they were building the fire, Hogen heard them arguing about subjectivity and objectivity. He joined them and said: There is a big stone. Do you consider it to be inside or outside your mind?'</p>
<p>One of the monks replied: 'From the Buddhist viewpoint everything is an objectification of mind, so I would say that the stone is inside my mind.'</p>
<p>'Your head must feel very heavy’, observed Hogen. 'if you are carrying around a stone like that in your mind.'</p>
