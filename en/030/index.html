    <h1>Calling Card</h1>

<p>Keichu, the great Zen teacher of the Meiji era, was the head of Tofuku, a cathedral in Kyoto. One day the governor of Kyoto called upon him for the first time.</p>

<p>His attendant presented the card of the governor, which read: Kitagaki, Governor of Kyoto.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no business with such a fellow.&#8221; said Keichu to his attendant. Tell him to get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attendant carried the card back with apologies. &#8220;That was my error,&#8221; said the governor and with a pencil he scratched out the words Governor of Kyoto. &#8220;Ask your teacher again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that Kitagaki?&#8221; exclaimed the teacher when he saw the card. &#8220;I want to see that fellow.</p>
