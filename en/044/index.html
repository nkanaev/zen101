    <h1>The Thief Who Became a Disciple</h1>

<p>One evening as Shichiri Kojun was reciting sutras a thief with a sharp sword entered, demanding either his money or his life, Shichiri told him: &#8220;Do not disturb me. You an find the money in that drawer.&#8221; Then he resumed his recitation.</p>

<p>A little while afterwards he stopped and called: &#8220;Don"t take it all. I need some to pay taxes with tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intruder gathered up most of the money and started to leave. &#8220;Thank a person when you receive a gift,&#8221; Shichiri added. The man thanked him and made off.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the fellow was caught and confessed, among others, the offence against Shichiri. When Shichiri was called as a witness he said: &#8220;This man is no thief, at least as far as I am concerned. I gave him the money and he thanked me for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had finished his prison term, the man went to Shichiri and became his disciple.</p>
