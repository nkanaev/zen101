    <h1>Three Kinds of Disciples</h1>
    <p>A Zen master named Gettan lived in the latter part of the Tokugawa era. He used to say: " There are three kinds of disciples: those who impart Zen to others, those who maintain the temples and shrines, and then there are the rice bags and the clothes-hangers.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Gasan expressed the same idea. When he was studying under Tekisui, his teacher was very severe. Sometimes he even beat him. Other pupils would not stand this kind of teaching and quit. Gasan remained saying: &#8220;A poor disciple utilizes a teacher&#8217;s influence. A fair disciple admires a teacher&#8217;s kindness. A good disciple grows strong under a teacher&#8217;s discipline.&#8221;</p>
