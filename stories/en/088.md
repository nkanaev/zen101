# How to Write a Chinese Poem

A well-known Japanese poet was asked how to compose a Chinese poem. The usual Chinese poem is four lines," he explained. The first line contains the initial phrase; the second line, the continuation of that phase; the third line turns from this subject and begins a new one; and the fourth line brings the first three lines together. A popular Japanese song illustrates this:

> Two daughters of a silk merchant live in Kyoto,
> The elder is twenty, the younger, eighteen.  
> A soldier may kill with his sword,  
> But these girls slay men with their eyes.
