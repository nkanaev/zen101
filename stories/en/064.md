# Kasan Sweat

Kasan was asked to officiate at the funeral of a provincial lord. He had never met lords and nobler before so he was nervous.

When the ceremony started, Kasan sweated.

Afterwards, when he had returned, he gathered his pupils together. Kasan confessed that he was not yet qualified to be a teacher for he lacked the sameness of bearing in the world of fame that he possessed in the secluded temple. Then Kasan resigned and became the pupil of another master. Eight years later he returned to his former pupils, enlightened.
