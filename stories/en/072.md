# The Blockhead Lord

Two Zen teachers Daigu and Gudo, were invited to visit a lord. Upon arriving, Gudo said to the lord: "You are wise by nature and have an inborn ability to learn Zen."

"Nonsense," said Daigu "Why do you flatter this blockheads? He may be a lord, but he doesn't know anything of Zen." So, instead of building a temple for Gudo the lord built it for Daigu and studied Zen with him.
